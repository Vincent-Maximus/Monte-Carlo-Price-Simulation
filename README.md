# Monte Carlo Price Simulation


Monte Carlo simulations are powerful tools in many fields, including operations research, game theory, physics, economics, and finance. <br>
It is a technique for understanding the impact of risk and uncertainty on decision-making. In short, a Monte Carlo simulation performs a large number of experiments with different random numbers generated from an underlying distribution of uncertain variables.
<br>In this project I've used Monte Carlo to predict the prices of Crypto   

If you like to dive deeper into the how's and why's, I've provided some useful links down below 

## Result
The program will provide a graph with all the simulation (in this example a 100)
